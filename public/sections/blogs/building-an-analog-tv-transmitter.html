    <h1>im gonna build a small tv station and the fcc cant do shit about it!! </h1>
    <p>while scrolling through my youtube recommendations, i came across this video of someone building an analog tv transmitter</p>

    <p>i figured "well i have nothing to do next week and have money for this" so i decided to waste money on ebay and order stuff. one thing i want to do differently here is have two converters and modulators connected through a potentiometer to mix the raw signal to emulate signal jamming.<br>
    heres a funny sheet i made , with the parts that have arrived / picked up so far</p>

    <p>i found someone selling a lot of 2 rf modulators for 14 dollars (plus $10 shipping). the sound output is mono but i decided "do i really want to spend a little more for stereo? no right, so buy that". i'm now in possesion of em.</p>
