        <p>so... i went to PR Comic Con just about a week ago for the first time, it was super coolio!! i saw so many amazing cosplays out there, but the only ones i took pictures were 2 miku's, a rin, and roblox pizza deliverer <i>(didnt take many pictures as i would've liked to, sowgy.,. qwq)</i>. i did buy a <code>404 page not found</code> pin, a kirby beanie, and a hatsune miku figurine! (awaaa, so cute!!) </p>

        <p>everyone was selling such cool stuff, lil figures, posters, figures, </p>
        <p>i also went to check their vidja games row, and... well its nothing really amazing for me. i own very few consoles, wii u, switch, 3ds, and xbox one, and none of the games really caught my attention for what i owned. it mostly consisted of licensed movie games, shovelware, and maybe some games that i already owned, so nothing special. although they were selling actual video game consoles i really want but dont have the money to fork over. they had maybe every cool color variant of the n64, probs a ps2 somewhere, a modded sp i believe and so much other cool retro stuff i cant own because well... im <span style="color:red;font-size:20px;;">Broke Ass Poor</span> (thats a reference to a game, email me title of the game for free oxygen!). for some reason i took a picture of this specific game on the wii for funnies</p>
        <img src="/images/blogs/comic-con-2025/chicken-shoot.jpg" alt="The front cover of a Wii game titled Chicken Shoot. Illustrated is a chicken with a crosshair aiming towards its chest. This game is considered shovelware"><br>
        <span>chicken shoot. its chicken shoot, the game where everyone has a chicken infestation problem and they make it your problem (not really)</span>
        <p>oh yeag! i also took a picture with that guy from lord of the rings (elija woods (i hope i spelt it right ^^")), and attended his q&a panel! hes a really nice guy, answered everyones questions with much care and detail. for some reason though there were like, what? 5 or 6 people asking the same questions about puerto rico? like fr tho there's already been one person who asked, just step down... he already told you the most hes ever been here was for work, not much else really.</p>

        <span>holy shit its frodo [Image used in accordance with provided license]</span>
        <p>lastly, i attended the cosplay showcase. i loved a lot of people's cosplays, some were even reeking of effort which i love to see!! i think i also saw like 6 different mikus, one whom the world belongs to, and the other who beams miku lazers (miku miku beam!! apperantly i think i was the only one in the crowd to shout the phrase lmao). again, i really did wish i took more pictures, but thats alright, its the fun i had is all that matters innit? (^^).</p>

        <span>A picture of elite with Strawberry Miku. (finally figured out the cosplay!) I cant even begin to describe how good it looks! (the world is hers!)</span>
        <p>i hope to return again to comic con... maybe i could give a shot at making a certain protogen real(???) and go as that(???????)????(??????)(in other words, i may want to dabble in making a fursuit, i think it'd be cool! >w&#60;)</p>
