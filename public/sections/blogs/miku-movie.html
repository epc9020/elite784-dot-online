        <span>note to non-puerto rican readers: i use "monopoly theater" to refer to Carribean Cinemas, which is quite literally the only movie theater chain on this island.</span><br><br>
        <span>note to those worried about spoilers (somehow after this long of time): </span><span style="color:rgb(30, 255, 0)">worry not! </span><span>this blog post does not contain spoilers for <i>Colorful Stage! The Movie: The Miku Who Can't Sing</i>. if you havent watched the movie, dont want spoilers and youll somehow figure out how to watch it now, dont worry, as i dont talk much about the movie here. just how it made me feel.</span>
        <p>
            5 months of monitoring <span>(heh)</span>. five months of radio silence from the monopoly theater five months of waiting. finally... i can say
            "i watched the project sekai movie!"<br>
            so i'll say it now... but in caps this time.<br>
            I WATCHED THE PROJECT SEKAI MOVIE HOLY SHIT I ALMOST BURST TO TEARS AT THE END QWQ
        </p>
        <img src="/images/blogs/miku-movie/holy-shit.JPG" alt="Me as Kagamine Len in a dark theater room."><br>
        <span>holy shit i still cant believe i got to watch this movie... (╥u╥) <-- tears of unfiltered joy</span>
        <p>
            miku fans in the freedom land will wonder "didnt that release back in april?". and yes, it did. in the mainland that is. i, however, live in the land down under the US called "puerto rico". and down here, some of the more niche things dont usually come down here (unless you look really hard or by a miracle it does). the movie wouldnt have come here if it werent for the Lusca Film Fest (according to Wikipedia, the Lusca Film Fest brings movies "that otherwise wouldn't come to Puerto Rico").
        </p>
        <h2>the first i ever heard of such a thing</h2>
        <span>i think i wrote this in past tense, im not sure i wrote this at 1 am (alternatively, i wrote this at 25:00)</span>
        <p>
            so i was in a discord server chatting about, and somebody makes a statement including both the words 'miku' and 'movie' in the same sentence. "miku movie? <strong>miku movie?!</strong> <em>holy. fucking. shit.</em>" i never heard of such a thing, hell i didnt know such a thing could manifest. but it did exist! there it was in the search results, english wikipedia article and all. no lie, mention of that got me playing the game the movie is based on. rumor said that it would've been releasing somewhere around may iirc! of course, there was only one problem...<br><br>
            <i>i live in puerto rico</i><br><br>
            US and PR arent the same. if a movie comes out in the us, it'll probably release months later over here. so, exciting! but boo! introducing waiting. plus, what if it never does come down here, thats sad and fucking lame!<br><br>
            nevertheless, after hearing the news, it started something inside me. an... <em>obsession</em>... an unhealthy one at that. some three weeks later though, something would appear that would make this even more unhealthier than it already was...
        </p>
        <h2>the part where it appears</h2>
        <p>
            this one thing made me lose it two weeks later after its inception.<br><br>
            so during a search at the end of may, i encountered something peculiar: <a href="https://caribbeancinemas.com/movie/1028/">a placeholder page for the hatsune miku movie.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            further searches hinted that the movie wouldve been releasing somewhere at the end of the month. i got so exited! so i continued monitoring, and then...<br><br>
            <i>nothing happened.</i><br><br>
            nada. zero. silencio. my hopes got... too high. i was getting really irritated, nothing was making sense. i was searching for weeks upon weeks. some sources from the monopoly theater stated it already had released, some other sources said it wouldve been delayed. hell even some posts suggested that it released the same day as in freedom land. <br><br>
            nothing added up. was it not going to come over here? then why in hell would monopoly theater go though the effort of making a placeholder page for the movie?!
        </p>
        <h2>were the frequencies never meant to meet here?</h2>
        <p>
            i kinda just gave up. i would do some investigating here and there occasionally, but for the most part it was radio silence. hell one person who appeared to be from this decrepet island (according to them) i told about the placeholder page on reddit appeared to give up too and just asked where to watch the movie in the corresponding subreddit. someone gave them the link to the pleb movie cam video (if you know you know). of course i also have the video on hand. but since i am who i am, i didnt watch it. "i want to watch this shit, in a room, with people, with the one common interest of liking vocaloid."<br><br>
            and so nothing really happened for 4 months. and then...
        </p>
        <h2>blurt of words.</h2>
        <p>
            while i was talking to a group of friends about random bullshit, i mentioned how the miku movie never released here. suddenly one of my friends blurted it out:
            <br><i>"but the miku movie is releasing here"</i>
            <br><br>un. fucking. believable.
            <br>i was actually dumbfounded, i immediately called bullshit. "this is for real, you're not fucking with me?"
            <br>he shows me proof. actual, live proof.<br>
            its real?? it- its actually for realsies?! <span>omg omg omg</span>
        </p>
        <h2>"holy fucking shit"</h2>
        <p>
            after hearing that, <i>yes, it is actually releasing here, you can stop your insane ramblings</i>, i was ecstatic than i had ever have been.<br><br>
            i then had an idea: what if i cosplayed as len to the theater?
            some people in the us of a had done such a thing (cosplay as vocaloids to the movie), and ive never done such a thing in a more large open public space. i thought why the hell not?! of course id have to do it as cheap as im possibly able (under the obligatory amount of 30 dollars, around the exact amount i had in my debit card then).<br><br>
            so i bought a wig (first time buying one of those things), cheapest tie i could find, and black fabric to somehow make a sailor collar. and i also somehow got a free trial of prime (i had one prior to order stuff back in '23), so that would give me the exquisite fast free shipping i need.

            <br>28 dolaer, painful but worf et.
            <br><br>while i waited i might as well make some things that i can make with what i currently have. i happened to have this yellow ribbon laying around, so i took a sharpie to it and made the thingy len wears on his left side of his pants.

            week later i got the thingies. for the rest, i would be using some black cargo pants that i would roll up and tape on the yellow ribbon on the bottom ends, and a shirt that just so happened to have the minimum characteristics of len's shirt: yellow on black ribbon on both ends of sleeves. its called literally my school uniform.

        <p>
            the black fabric i had ordered though, oh it was cheap alright. by that i mean literally 1 ply toilet paper amount of thinness. i ended up not using it and therefore not making the sailor collar. furthermore, i really didnt understand any of this sewing stuff, maybe i'll probably try to learn to understand it after this given enough time.
        </p>

        <span>im not sure what to use this for now...</span>
        <h2>so our frequencies finally meet...</h2>
        <p>
            after many months, finally.. me and some other peoples in a room, watching one movie we all wanted to watch. to be honest, i really thought the theater was going to be half empty. but nah, it had a sizable ammount of people. i did get there before more came in though, so i secured a seat in a nice spot. those that came in later had to sit in the front front row (aka the seats that give you neck pain).<br>

            there were a handful of people cosplaying, and after the movie i took pictures with about 4 of them!

        </p>

        <span>the damn angle i decided to pose in does not do my cosplay any favours... excellent past self.<br>in another note: ooh shiny...</span>
        <img src="/images/blogs/miku-movie/employed-miku.png" alt="To the left of the image, a Miku who appears to be employed at Dominoes pizza. To the right, me again."><br>
        <span>miku but now employed. specifically, at dominoes.</span>
        <img src="/images/blogs/miku-movie/arcade-lol.png" alt="From left to right: me again, cosplayer as KAITO, and another cosplayer as Miku. I am unsure of the theme of their cosplay, ie where it comes from. Will write proper description once I am more informed of the origin."><br>
        <span>Len, KAITO, and Miku in an arcade from the movie theater. can anyone let me know thru email what KAITO and Miku's cosplays originate from so i can write a proper alt text description? tnx :)</span>
        <p>
            as for the movie, it was really beautiful its message, it almost left me in tears.. it was that good it was...
            there is one thing though i find strange... the after show that people were talking about at the end... it was cut off... im not sure if it was a decision made by lusca, but damn it i waited 5 months for this so i aint complaining. i did end up checking my pleb theatercam copy to see what exactly i missed... not much, but maybe thats because im watching it like a pleb.

            anyways, thats all! if anyone from lusca just so happens to stumble upon this... thank you... you allowed her voice to reach us in this hot as hell island.
