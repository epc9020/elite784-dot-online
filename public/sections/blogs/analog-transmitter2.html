    <p>the capture card is now in my possesion, and it works perfectly fine. if i were to recommend a capture device for digitizing vhs tapes, just look up usb composite tv tuners. tv tuners wont care if the composite signal gets terrible unlike some other composite to usb capture devices, which go blank if theres a speck of dust in the video (i may be overexagerating it, but if the signal:noise ratio is moderately to the noise side the video goes blank. this especially happens on those cheap easycap generic composite to usb devices)</p>

    <p>yesterday i also tested the rf modulators with a spare potentiometer i found somewhere somehow. i discovered that the way i want to recreate the signal jamming isnt going to give me the desirable result i want, so im gonna have to spend a bit more for the amps and antennas. also i added "hdmi to composite converter" to my shopping list, so theres that.</p>

    <br><p>You may be asking "elite, why are you trying to recreate signal jamming?" i want to create analog style videos without those mimic vhs filters.</p>
    <p>so, cool, more money to waste! i'll be picking up the crt tomorrow (at least that was free), once i get home with it i'll check if it has any issues, which hopefully it doesn't (foreshadowing o_o). otherwise more projects for me! (fOre shADOw O-O)</p>
