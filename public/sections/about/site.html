        <h2>the thought.</h2>
        <p>for the longest time i've always wanted a
            website of my own but never knew where to start (i did at some point make something in <a href="/images/stupid site.png">wix</a> and carrd.co (now lost to time) but those never went anywhere). thats
            when one faithful day i was browsing <a href="https://protoweb.org">protoweb's</a> geocities archived sites, and thats where it hit me. "<i>neocities...</i>"
            i never even heard of neocities, and somehow those two words materialized in my head. that thought started all of this.</p>
        <h2>idiot's first lines of html</h2>

        <img src="/images/beginings.jpg" height="300"><br>
        <p>i think the fact that i have to write my own html to make site is what got me here in the first place. neocities was like a breath of fresh air! 
            me, in control of everything in ways i never imagined before, all for the low low price of  air. it was exactly what i'd been looking for all this time!
