        <h2>up to speed</h2>
        <p>for the last few months, i've been struggling with <i>dynamic ip</i>. for those that dont know what this is, here's my explenation on what that is.<br><br>
        a dynamic ip address is a constantly changing ip address set by your internet service provider (isp for short). 
        this is a problem when trying to self host your own server.  
        dynamic dns (ddns for short) aims to solve this problem by using a program that reports the current public facing ip address to the ddns server, 
        and the ddns provider changes the dns record to match the current ip of the server. i'm writing this very late, so if that didn't make sense, 
        here's a visual diagram that shows how ddns works.</p><br>click on the image for fullscreen!!<br>

        <p>uhh anyways..</p>
        <h2>the better solution, under my nose the entire time</h2>
        <p>a peer on a protogen discord (hey Meeg!) introduced me to tunnels on cloudflare, which is like ddns but much more easier (in my experience). im suprised i never
            found out about this, since i use cloudflare on all my domains. using these "<i>tunnels</i>", i was able to easily make a subdomain to my home server!
        </p>

        <p>now that i've figured this out, i can figure out other cool web server stuff i can do! keep watch for new stuff on the web server! also please note, 
            that due to a nightly problem with my router i cant resolve, dont expect to be able to connect to the web server during the night here over on the 
            AST/GMT -0400 time zone!</p>
