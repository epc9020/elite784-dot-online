        <h1>webserve3.html - simple server status reporting script implementation for visitors</h1>
        <span>javascript - written 15/1/25 @728 and posted @ on the same day</span>
        <p>i wrote a little script for the server that when loaded on this site's index page, will report the status of the server.<br>
        this means whenever someone goes to the index page on this site, if the server is reachable, the script located there will change the text in a span element to <span style="color:lime;">ON-LINE</span><br>
        if the server isnt reachable, nothing happens and the span element will show <span style="color:red">OFF-LINE</span> instead.</p>
