        <p>i did say i was going to can this project, but maybe i can save it somehow(?)<br>
        anyhoo, i've made some progress on this site!</p>
        <h2>alpha phase may be finished..!</h2>
        <p>ive got most of the nessecary components of The Directory working, those being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Button: A button to send you to a random site on The Directory</li>
            <li>The actual directory: y'know, the directory section!</li>
            <li>Featured section: Sites that'll be featured every month or so</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and some scripts!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the random link script: the script that powers the random button</li>
            <li>description script: hover over a site, and get more details about it!</li>
            <li>random site list order script: script that gives all directory categories variety every time you go into it!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>when alpha gone, closed beta comes in</h2>
        <p>the closed beta will be limited to peoples sites i currently know of (which would be sites on my cool sites section) for testing. no further details will be
            provided.
