        <p>These are two sets of low power analog transmitters, made out of consumer grade components bought from ebay and Walmart. 
            They broadcast on channels 3 and 4 in mono sound only, due to the limitations of the signal modulators. 
            they do indeed comply with the FCC's part 15 of something transmission may not affect other signals and will accept to be affected by 
            other signals, whether i like it or not.</p>
